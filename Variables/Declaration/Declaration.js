// To use a variable, you've first got to create it â€” more accurately, we call this declaring the variable. To do this, we type the keyword let followed by the name you want to call your variable:

let myName;
let myAge;

// Initializing a variable -- Once you've declared a variable, you can initialize it with a value. You do this by typing the variable name, followed by an equals sign (=), followed by the value you want to give it. For example:

myName = 'Abhas Jaiswal'
myAge = 21

// You can declare and initialize a variable at the same time, like this:

//let myName = 'Abhas Jaiswal';
//let myAge = 21;
